# fornow-js
A very simple dummy API placeholder for now

`vite + react + express + typescript` 

This is my initial design, and I will keep update the app, feel free to improve the app

## Run
1. clone this repo
2. `npm i`
3. npx tsx server.ts


## Note
to customize the endpoints you just need edit content inside <b>./public/Endpoints</b> folder
